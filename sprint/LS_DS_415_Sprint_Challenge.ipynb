    "After a week of Natural Language Processing, you've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",

    "The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more managable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

LOVE their Poke and seaweed salad and they have a few other good ones too AND out of the 6 times I've gone, I never had to wait for a table. \\n   BIG But however, Absolutely Trust in these words and the others that say the service is not good and the woman that are waiting on you are mostly standing in the back doing nothing. I have not sat at the bar yet.  \\n   \\n   If you have somewhere to be, do not come here. It's the slowest sushi restaurant I've been to in LV and I've been to at least 10 in this city. Look forward to them bringing someone else's order to your table, not checking up on you for water until after it's gone (not every time but enough times to be parched), they take your AYCE card away and don't return it so you can order more; you have to ask for it back. And thats about it. They're pleasant though, not mean at all, they just don't have things very organized and don't tend to you as they should.  \\n\\n  Great food, bad service. I have not been there once out of 6 times and the service changed. Literally. I don't just bash restaurants and I hope you see I'm not doing that. I'm not hard to please and LOVE sushi. I wish SO much the service was better b.c the food really is good, it's just not here. Thats the only reason for the 3 stars, the food. So, go for the food and if you're hungry, expect to be there for a bit.\",\n",

They do everything very quickly and not with much care or attention. As soon as I drove off, I noticed what a terrible job they had done on my hands. None of my cuticles were pushed back or any dead skin clipped off. I could have done a better job at home. \\n\\nI went back to speak to the manager and she was not courteous and pretty rude. She refused to accept that it wasn\\'t done well and just kept arguing and speaking to her coworkers in chinese. I gave up and said I\\'ll leave but won\\'t come back to this place. Her response to me \"yeah go don\\'t come back\". This obviously doesn\\'t care to lose business from clients and I don\\'t think this seems new to her with such an unprofessional attitude.\\n\\nThis place isn\\'t cheaper than any other place and by far the worst I\\'ve tried in the city so far.\\n\\nThey\\'re so bad they don\\'t even send you out with dry nail polish.

I wasn\\'t asked what pressure I like for the leg or hand massage.\\nThe \"nail bar\" area is fine- also not super comfortable.\\nNo WiFi capabilities. \\nNot sure what they were going for with decor, it\\'s \"interesting\"\\n\\nBottom line: will not return.',\n",
